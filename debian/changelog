openstack-debian-images (1.9) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Merge Azure script into build-openstack-debian-image:
    - Now using ext4 and not ext3 anymore (Closes: #819761).
  * Added an explicite LICENSE.txt Apache-2.0 file.

 -- Thomas Goirand <zigo@debian.org>  Fri, 13 May 2016 14:13:04 +0200

openstack-debian-images (1.8) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Adds missing python3-cffi-backend which python3-cryptography seem to need
    in Stretch (this otherwise fails debootstrap).
  * Fix console blanking fix in Stretch (ie: /etc/kbd/config doesn't exist
    anymore).

openstack-debian-images (1.7) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Ondřej Nový ]
  * Fixed VCS URLs (https).

  [ Thomas Goirand ]
  * Added "biosdevname=0 net.ifnames=0" to the kernel default command line, to
    avoid eth renaming, which destroys the network. Though this is a temporary
    hack until we get a more recent cloud-init which handles it.
  * Removed Thomas Bechtold <toabctl@debian.org> from uploaders, as it is
    unlikely he will upload again.
  * Standards-Version is now 3.9.7.

 -- Thomas Goirand <zigo@debian.org>  Wed, 20 Apr 2016 14:45:02 +0200

openstack-debian-images (1.6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added aptitude as installed packages. (Closes: #797962)

 -- Thomas Goirand <zigo@debian.org>  Mon, 14 Sep 2015 09:58:29 +0000

openstack-debian-images (1.5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Using httpredir.debian.org instead of http.debian.net (Closes: #792362).

 -- Thomas Goirand <zigo@debian.org>  Mon, 14 Sep 2015 09:55:43 +0000

openstack-debian-images (1.4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added script to build a murano image in the contrib folder.
  * Now changing the version number on the output file depending on the release
    name of Debian.
  * Added patches contributed by Gaudenz Steinlin <gaudenz@debian.org>
    (Closes: #784334):
    - By default the rescue and emergency shell are started on the boot
      console. This is ttyS0 on this image in order to have the boot output on
      the serial console which is accessible by "nova console-log". But there
      is no input device connected to this console, so the shells there are
      pretty useless. On the other hand tty0 is accessible via the spice or
      VNC console.
    - Only install extlinux in /boot/extlinux. Some parts were installed in
      / only, others in both locations.
    - Remove the quiet flag from the standard boot command. This is useful on
      desktops to not clutter the boot screen, but not on a cloud image.
    - Use symlinks to kernel and initrd. This allows seamless kernel upgrades.
  * Changed the loging for the list of packages for wheezy and other releases
    of Debian (it was selecting the list of package for Wheezy for Stretch and
    buster).
  * Added a couple of sync calls to make sure we don't have a race condition
    when removing the loopback device using kpartx.

 -- Thomas Goirand <zigo@debian.org>  Wed, 06 May 2015 22:30:46 +0200

openstack-debian-images (1.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Removed the tweak of /etc/modules, as acpiphp and pci_hotplug aren't in the
    Jessie kernel: they are built not as module (Closes: #783340).
  * Also adds security repository if building an image for Jessie. Previously,
    this was done only for Wheezy (Closes: #783480).
  * Adds dbus + libpam-systemd when building a Jessie image, and acpid +
    acpi-support-base when building a Wheezy image, so that ACPI shutdown works
    by default (Closes: #783448).
  * Adds nano as default when not using the --minimal flag (Closes: #783341).

 -- Thomas Goirand <zigo@debian.org>  Tue, 05 May 2015 15:39:59 +0200

openstack-debian-images (1.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Uses 2GB by default as initial HDD space for the image, as 1GB isn't big
    enough for building a Jessie image anymore (Closes: #776217). Thanks to
    Steve McIntyre <steve@einval.com> for the bug report.
  * Error as non-zero in case of an error (Closes: #776216). Thanks to Steve
    McIntyre <steve@einval.com> for the bug report and patch.
  * Allow stretch and buster as release names.
  * Adds the contrib/official-debian-image-hook script used for generating the
    official Debian image.

openstack-debian-images (0.11) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Correctly writes in ${MOUNT_DIR}/etc/modules and not in the /etc/modules of
    the computer creating the image (Closes: #728943).
  * Corrects "Using the -ar option truncates 5% off the end of the resized
    filesystem." by using Mi instead of M when using parted (Closes: #728939).

  [ Thomas Goirand ]
  * Added a hook script.
  * Installs cloud-init, cloud-utils and cloud-initramfs-growroot from
    backports in Wheezy, since they are now available from there.

    mirror addresses.
  * Added an option to choose the initial image size.
  * Made Mehdi's feature to automatically shrink images to a minimal size as

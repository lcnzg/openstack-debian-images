openstack-debian-images (0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added "blacklist pcspkr" in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf.
  * rm /lib/udev/write_net_rules (note: it should be diverted rather than just
    rm, this is temporary until I have time to fix this).
  * Added loading of acpiphp and pci_hotplug kernel modules (required for
    mounting Cinder volumes).

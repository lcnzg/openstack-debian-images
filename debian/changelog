  [ Thomas Goirand ]
  * Added a hook script.
  * Installs cloud-init, cloud-utils and cloud-initramfs-growroot from
    backports in Wheezy, since they are now available from there.
  * Added a --source-list-mirror option to fill the sources.list with custom
    mirror addresses.
  * Added an option to choose the initial image size.
  * Made Mehdi's feature to automatically shrink images to a minimal size as
    optional, since it doesn't entirely work and is very slow.

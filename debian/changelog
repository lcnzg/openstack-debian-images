openstack-debian-images (1.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Removed the tweak of /etc/modules, as acpiphp and pci_hotplug aren't in the
    Jessie kernel: they are built not as module (Closes: #783340).
  * Also adds security repository if building an image for Jessie. Previously,
    this was done only for Wheezy (Closes: #783480).

    Steve McIntyre <steve@einval.com> for the bug report.
  * Error as non-zero in case of an error (Closes: #776216). Thanks to Steve
    McIntyre <steve@einval.com> for the bug report and patch.

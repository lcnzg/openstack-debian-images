.SH NAME
build\-openstack\-debian\-image \- build a Debian image to be used with OpenStack
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B build\-openstack\-debian\-image
.B \-\-release|\-r <jessie|wheezy>
[ OPTIONS ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The
.I build\-openstack\-debian\-image
shell script will build a Debian image which can be used in an OpenStack IaaS
cloud. The resulting (Qcow2 and raw images) contains initramfs\-growroot so
that the root partition will be resized (during the initramfs phase, before
mouting anything) to match the flavor selected when using "nova boot". Later on
during the boot process, cloud\-init will resize the root partition on the fly
(resize is performed when the partition is already mounted read\-write, since
recent kernel allow that for ext3).

Cloud\-init is setup to use an Ec2 metadata server, which is what OpenStack is
compatible with. A "debian" user will be used to receive the ssh key from the
user data blob. This user is setup without a password (eg: adduser
\-\-disabled\-password).  Once logged as this "debian" user in your new virtual
machine, you can "sudo" to root from that user, without needing a password. The
root password is "password" by default, and ssh into the root user without
using an ssh keypair is disabled by default (PermitRootLogin without-password
is set in /etc/ssh/sshd_config).
